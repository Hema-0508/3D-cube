### 🧊 3D Cube Project

A visually engaging **3D Cube animation** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Three.js, if used)**. This project demonstrates 3D transformations, rotations, and lighting effects to create a realistic cube that rotates smoothly in real-time.

#### 🚀 Features

* Fully interactive **3D cube animation**
* Smooth rotation and hover effects
* Responsive and lightweight design
* Clean and reusable code structure
* Built for learning 3D transformations and CSS animations

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure
* **CSS3** – 3D Transforms & Animations
* **JavaScript / Three.js** – Logic & interactivity

#### 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases the fundamentals of **3D design and motion in web development**, making it ideal for beginners exploring 3D effects or developers practicing animation control.

#### 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding **3D transformations** (rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ)
* Using **perspective and transform-style** properties effectively
* Creating **interactive visual effects** with minimal code
